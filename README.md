### This repo is now deprecated! You do not need to clone this, but it is still available for your reference.

### Overview:
This is a microservice that returns game info in JSON format to the [[Redacted] Project](https://github.com/Redacted-Team/4350_002_Fall23_BucStop).

### Project Structure:
* The application handles HTTP calls in the microController.cs file in the /GameMicroServer/Controllers directory.
* It only handles an HTTP Get call to the path /Micro. So if the application was running locally, you would call [http://localhost/Micro](http://localhost/Micro).
* This application is deployed alongside the BucStop project with docker compose, see [[Redacted] Project](https://github.com/Redacted-Team/4350_002_Fall23_BucStop) for more details.
